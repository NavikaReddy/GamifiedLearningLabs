        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>There are n cities numbered from 1 to n. Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi.
          Return the least distance path from source city to destination city.
        Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.</p>
